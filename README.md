# Pierre's Bakery

#### By Kirsten Opstad 

#### A console application for a fictional bakery

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .Net 6

## Description

### Objectives (MVP)

Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

* There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

* When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

* A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

*  The application will return the total cost of the order.

* The application will account for the following deals:

  Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
  Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.

All functionality for the models should be tested using red, green, refactor workflow.

### Goals
1. Meet MVP âœ…
2. Allow users to buy different kinds of Bread and Pastry.
3. Add additional deals beyond the ones mentioned above.
4. Stretch Goal: Use class inheritance to DRY up code for the Bread and Pastry class.
5. Stretch Goal: Allow users to keep adding to an order. In order to do this, you will need to use static variables. See the lesson on static variables to complete this objective.
